# improc_slides

These are the slides I used for a Digital Image Processing course (in Spanish language) I gave years ago.
It was oriented for university students and Medical Physic specialists. Back then I had only five html files configured to work with the [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git) and [Mathjax.js](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax.git) libraries.

Now I'm using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) taking advantage of the Jinja templates to refactor some of the code.
The figures used in the slides were downloaded from Internet. I'm not pretty sure where I got all of them, so if you consider there are
issues with this, you can contact me if you look into the slides.

Just run `python app.py` and go to the address that the terminal shows up when the flask server is running (normally localhost:5000).
